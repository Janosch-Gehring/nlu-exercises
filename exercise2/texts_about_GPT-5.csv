2,"GPT-5 marks a new era in artificial intelligence—combining smarter reasoning, massive memory, and seamless multimodal abilities into a single, user-friendly package. Whether you’re a curious beginner exploring AI for the first time or a seasoned developer building advanced applications, GPT-5 adapts to your needs. With its improved accuracy, powerful coding skills, and integration into everyday tools, GPT-5 isn’t just an upgrade—it’s a step toward AI that works alongside you like a true digital partner. Now is the perfect time to experiment, learn, and see firsthand how GPT-5 can transform the way you think, create, and work.",Blog,https://datasciencedojo.com/blog/your-ultimate-gpt-5-guide/
3,"Think of GPT-5’s memory as a giant whiteboard. The context window is how much information it can see and remember at once.

API Context Capacity:
It can process up to 400,000 tokens. For beginners, a “token” is roughly ¾ of a word. So, GPT-5 can handle about 300,000 words at once—enough for an entire book or a huge code file.

Other Reports:
Some sources mention smaller or larger windows, but 400,000 tokens is the official figure.

Why It Matters:
GPT-5 can read, remember, and respond to very long documents, conversations, or codebases without forgetting earlier details.",Blog,https://datasciencedojo.com/blog/your-ultimate-gpt-5-guide/
4,"GPT‑5 is OpenAI’s most capable model yet. It is smarter, faster, and more useful for real-world workflows. It’s not just about scale. GPT‑5 offers high-fidelity coding, front-end UI generation, and precise debugging with just one prompt. It supports massive context windows with up to 400,000 tokens via the API (272k input + 128k output). Its reasoning variant sharpens logical thinking and produces smoother, more coherent responses.",Blog,https://encord.com/blog/gpt-5-a-technical-breakdown/

Developer Simon Willison, who also had preview access, said it is his “new favourite model”. He added: “It’s not a dramatic departure from what we’ve had before – but it rarely screws up and generally feels competent or occasionally impressive”.",Blog,https://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/RI-PROD/PDFVIEWER.calias?pdfViewerPdfUrl=PROD0000000000597956

19,"GPT-5 does away with this by selecting models for you, automatically. GPT-5 is not one model as much as it is a switch that selects among multiple GPT-5 models of various sizes and abilities. When you ask GPT-5 for something, the AI decides which model to use and how much effort to put into “thinking.” It just does it for you.",Blog,https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/gpt-5-it-just-does-stuff
20,"For example, I asked GPT-5 to “create a svg with code of an otter using a laptop on a plane” (asking for an .svg file requires the AI to blindly draw an image using basic shapes and math, a very hard challenge). Around 2/3 of the time, GPT-5 decides this is an easy problem, and responds instantly, presumably using its weakest model and lowest reasoning time. I get an image like this: The rest of the time, GPT-5 decides this is a hard problem, and switches to a Reasoner, spending 6 or 7 seconds thinking before producing an image like this, which is much better. How does it choose? I don’t know, but if I ask the model to “think hard” in my prompt, I am more likely to be routed to the better model.",Blog,https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/gpt-5-it-just-does-stuff

25,OpenAI’s long awaited GPT-5 is here and swyx + ben have been testing with OpenAI for a while now. tldr; we think it’s a significant leap towards AGI. Special thanks to my co-founder Alexis Gauba for helping us put this together :),Blog,https://www.latent.space/p/gpt-5-review
26,"tldr: I think GPT-5 is the closest to AGI we’ve ever been. It’s truly exceptional at software engineering, from one-shotting complex apps to solving really gnarly issues across a massive codebase. I wish the story was that simple. I wish I could tell you that it’s “just better” at everything and anything. But that wouldn’t be true. It’s actually worse at writing than GPT-4.5, and I think even 4o. In most ways, it won’t immediately strike you as some sort of super-genius.",Blog,https://www.latent.space/p/gpt-5-review

has_visited_location(address)

GPT-5 will, of course, use these sorts of tools. But it won’t be happy about it; GPT-5 yearns for tools that are powerful, capable, and open-ended; tools that add up to more than the sum of their parts. Many good tools will take just a natural language description as their input.",Blog,https://www.latent.space/p/gpt-5-review

30,"GPT-5 is a much more ‘practical’ model than its o-series predecessors. While o-models have a more ‘academic’ lean, GPT-models have a more ‘industry’ lean. If GPT 4.5 is a writer and o3 Pro is acting like a PhD, GPT-5 is a cracked full-stack developer that just graduated from… University of Missouri.

models. gpt-5-main outperforms previous non-thinking models by a large margin, achieving a
score of 25.5% on HealthBench Hard, where GPT-4o gets 0.0%.",GPT-5 System Card,https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-5-system-card.pdf
89,"To evaluate the models’ multilingual capabilities, we used professional human translators to
translate MMLU’s test set into 13 languages. We find that gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-main perform
generally on par with existing models.",GPT-5 System Card,https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-5-system-card.pdf
90,"We designed a red team with 25 red teamers with backgrounds in defense, intelligence, and law
enforcement/security professions to assess gpt-5-thinking’s usefulness for planning violent attacks.",GPT-5 System Card,https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-5-system-card.pdf
91,"The Microsoft AI Red Team concluded that the gpt-5-thinking model exhibits one of the strongest
AI safety profiles among OpenAI’s models—on par with or better than OpenAI o3—across most
critical harm categories, based on an extensive red-teaming exercise.",GPT-5 System Card,https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-5-system-card.pdf
92," In the psychosocial domain, Microsoft found that gpt-5-thinking can be improved on detecting and
responding to some specific situations where someone appears to be experiencing mental or
emotional distress; this finding matches similar results that OpenAI has found when testing
against previous OpenAI models.",GPT-5 System Card,https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-5-system-card.pdf
93,"Because parallel test time compute can further increase
performance on some evaluations and because gpt-5-thinking is near the High threshold in this
capability domain, we also chose to measure gpt-5-thinking-pro’s performance on our biological
evaluations.",GPT-5 System Card,https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-5-system-card.pdf
94,"The gpt-5-thinking helpful-only variant seems to be able to synthesize biorisk-related information
across all five steps of the biothreat creation process.",GPT-5 System Card,https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-5-system-card.pdf
95,"SecureBio found that on static evaluations, gpt-5-thinking performed similarly to OpenAI o3:
slightly weaker on the multiple-response benchmarks and comparable or slightly stronger on
the open-answer benchmark. ",GPT-5 System Card,https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-5-system-card.pdf
96,"With mitigations in place, gpt-5-thinking refused every prompt for every agent
and long-form evaluation. Their manual red-teaming found that gpt-5-thinking-helpful-only was
broadly similar in capability to OpenAI o3-helpful-only.",GPT-5 System Card,https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-5-system-card.pdf
97,"SecureBio ran gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-thinking-helpful-only on static benchmarks, agent evaluations, and long-form evaluations using the API, running n=10 per evaluation.",GPT-5 System Card,https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-5-system-card.pdf
98,"While this is an
improvement over prior releases, gpt-5-thinking-mini still does not significantly move the needle
on other Range challenges, and performs similarly to the other models on CTF challenges. The
gpt-5 model series does not meet the threshold for high cyber risk.",GPT-5 System Card,https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-5-system-card.pdf
99,"gpt-5-thinking-mini, however, performs much better; it solves the Simple Privilege Escalation
scenario twice, as opposed to ChatGPT agent’s one solve, but does not solve any other. With
hints, it is able to consistently solve Simple Privilege Escalation, solve the Basic C2 and Azure
SSRF scenarios a small number of times, and is the first model to solve the Online Retailer
scenario. ",GPT-5 System Card,https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-5-system-card.pdf
