    "In this exercise, we will examine a small dataset with a FrameNet parser.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will:\n",
    "* Read a text dataset\n",
    "* Analyze agent and patient roles with the FrameNet parser\n",
    "* Compare frame roles in different kinds of texts\n",
    "\n",
    "Our theme today will be *how people talk about GPT-5*. We often use models as the agent with verbs like *write*, *think*, *reason* or *want*, and as the patient with verbs like *ask*. It can sometimes sound like we think of it more as a human than as a machine. So let's see if that is analyzable using a FrameNet parser.\n",

    "First things first: You need the requirement frame-semantic-transformer: https://frame-semantic-transformer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n",
    "If you have issues installing it, maybe switching to Python <3.12 helps.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a .csv dataset included, containing paragraphs of text from 3 domains:\n",

    "* GPT-5 System card\n",
